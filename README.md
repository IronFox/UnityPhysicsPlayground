Unity Physics Playground
========================

Creates various (all?) physical elements made available through the standard Unity physics subsystem.
A character physics entity can be used to explore the playground and interact with some elements (like cloth).
Follow the on-screen help-text to see how to control the character.
A 'reset'-button allows to reset the scene, since some interactions have persitent effects.
